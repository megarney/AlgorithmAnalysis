/*
 * The mode of a finite nonempty list of ùëõ real numbers ùëÜ is defined as the number that occurs the 
 * most times in the list. For example, the mode of [2,3,4,5,8,2,3,4,5,4,3,3] is 3 because three occurs 
 * the most times. For each representation of ùëÜ given below, describe using pseudo-code an algorithm to 
 * compute the mode following the pseudo-code conventions from our text.
